## Debugging

### Prerequisites

For running and debugging locally you will need the following:

* Visual Studio Code (<https://code.visualstudio.com/download>)
* npm (<https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm>)
  * Ensure you install node version using npm by running the following command: `npm install`


### Running the application locally and production build

Run the following commands:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
1. Client app build:

    The `npm build` task will build and ready for production release.
2. Run the WebApi project in Visual Studio.

While working on the client app you might want to run it by itself with BrowserSync enabled by running the following command:

```sh
ng serve
```
